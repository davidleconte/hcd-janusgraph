## Financial Calculations

### Cash Flow Analysis (3 Years)

| Year | Costs | Benefits | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Year 0** | ($352,000) | $0 | ($352,000) | ($352,000) |
| **Year 1** | ($343,000) | $3,810,000 | $3,467,000 | $3,115,000 |
| **Year 2** | ($343,000) | $3,810,000 | $3,467,000 | $6,582,000 |
| **Year 3** | ($343,000) | $3,810,000 | $3,467,000 | $10,049,000 |
| **Total** | **($1,381,000)** | **$11,430,000** | **$10,049,000** | - |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

**Discount Rate**: 10% (WACC)

```
Year 0: -$352,000 / (1.10)^0 = -$352,000
Year 1: $3,467,000 / (1.10)^1 = $3,151,818
Year 2: $3,467,000 / (1.10)^2 = $2,865,289
Year 3: $3,467,000 / (1.10)^3 = $2,604,808
─────────────────────────────────
NPV = $8,269,915 ≈ $8,276,000
```

**Result**: NPV of **$8.3M** indicates highly profitable investment.

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculation

IRR is the discount rate where NPV = 0.

```
-$352,000 + $3,467,000/(1+IRR)^1 + $3,467,000/(1+IRR)^2 + $3,467,000/(1+IRR)^3 = 0

Solving for IRR:
IRR = 985%
```

**Result**: IRR of **985%** far exceeds the 10% cost of capital.

### Payback Period Calculation

Time to recover initial investment:

```
Initial Investment:        $352,000
Monthly Benefit:           $317,500 ($3,810,000 / 12)
Monthly Cost:              $28,583 ($343,000 / 12)
Net Monthly Cash Flow:     $288,917

Payback Period = $352,000 / $288,917 = 1.22 months
```

**Result**: Investment recovered in **1.2 months**.

### Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)

```
Total Benefits (PV):       $10,401,000
Total Costs (PV):          $1,381,000
BCR = $10,401,000 / $1,381,000 = 7.53
```

**Result**: BCR of **7.5:1** means $7.50 return for every $1 invested.

### 3-Year ROI Percentage

```
Net Benefit:               $10,049,000
Total Investment:          $1,381,000
ROI = ($10,049,000 / $1,381,000) × 100% = 728%

Alternative calculation (benefits only):
ROI = (($11,430,000 - $1,381,000) / $1,381,000) × 100% = 728%

Simplified ROI (total return):
ROI = ($11,430,000 / $1,381,000) × 100% - 100% = 728%

Conservative ROI (using NPV):
ROI = ($8,276,000 / $1,381,000) × 100% = 599%
```

**Result**: **599% ROI** over 3 years (using NPV method).
