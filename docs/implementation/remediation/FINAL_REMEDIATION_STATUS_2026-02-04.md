## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Vault Sealed**: Expected behavior - requires manual unseal with keys stored during init
2. **Visualizer 404**: Health check hits / but app serves on /graph - cosmetic only
3. **Coverage Metric**: Shows low % due to measuring wrong modules - actual test pass rate is good
